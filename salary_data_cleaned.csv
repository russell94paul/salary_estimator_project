We're looking for a software engineer who wants to build and support a top-tier programmatic media buying and analytics platform, loves to build cool stuff and work hard, can communicate well, and has a personality that fits in with ours. Our development philosophy is to work as small, focused, nimble groups, building everything from front-end to the back-end. We divide up work on a product basis and you'd be responsible for making sure your features have a clear user-interface, perform and scale, and have legible and easy to maintain code. You may not be familiar with all of the specific technologies we use, but you should be excited about the opportunities to pick them up. The right person will feel at home at Goodway because: We prefer open-source, being scrappy/nimble, and family values over proprietary technologies, all-day meetings, and corporate bureaucracy. You can ditch your commute since we’re 100% virtual – everyone works at home but we get together a few times each year. We make being physically together a celebration filled with good times and opportunities for new experiences. We encourage personal growth and professional development through technical seminars/cyber-training, mentorships, and leadership opportunities. We have a long history of promoting from within and a career ladder that provides opportunities in both technical and managerial tracks.

We’re looking for engineers who are strong hands-on coders but experience in every technology we use is not critical, as long as you’re committed to learning what you’re not familiar with already. Solid understanding of data warehousing, relational databases, and data modeling/design techniques and tuning (non-relational database experience a plus). Advanced SQL skills including query optimization. Experience working in ""big data"" platforms and related tools & scripting languages including Amazon Redshift & EMR, Presto, Hive, Python, Spark, Scala, BASH & K-shell scripting, etc. Experience building data pipelines with open source tools such as Airflow and Argo. Modern web tech including: GraphQL, Node JS, REST APIs HTML-5, CSS, XML, JSON, Javascript and JS Libraries, etc. Strong design and coding skills in modern object-oriented or functional languages (Javascript, Java, C#, Python, Scala, etc).
